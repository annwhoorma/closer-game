# Closer Game

Hey, it's a game that I created for 21st birthday of a very special person. You are welcome to use it as well. Follow [this link](http://t.me/closergame_bot) to play, and I hope you enjoy :)

## Description

It's a telegram based game that generated a deck of cards and lets you draw from it. Every card has a description, and in case it's unclear you can read the rules provided in the bot. Below you can see some of the cards.

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
<img src="images/A/Size=Large, CardType=ActionKiss.png" style="width: 24%;"/>
<img src="images/Q/Size=Large, CardType=QuestionChangeMovie.png" style="width: 24%;"/>
<img src="images/Q/Size=Large, CardType=QuestionDream.png" style="width: 24%;"/>
<img src="images/R/Size=Large, CardType=Reversed (2).png" style="width: 24%;"/>
</div>

To create the cards, I used Figma which I never used before, so the cards are not perfect and I'm okay with it
